        While learning webdevelopment I will try out more of the frameworks
        and such and such. Keeping my mind open to learn new things. <br/>
        So far IÂ´ve learned HTML, CSS, JS, REACT, a bit of UX and using FIGMA, worked with Agile development using scrum and trello. <br/>
        Trying out different libraries in REACT, Styled components, Spring, React-router-dom, Using Hooks, props, state, useEffect, etc. <br />
        Now trying out NEXT.js also learned a bit of SASS, BOOTSTRAP, and connecting projects to FIREBASE. <br />
        I  have also a basic understanding of the JAVA syntax it was the first language I tried out.
